I establish technical infrastructure and social patterns that enable collaboration and participation, facilitate and inspire teams, and create and promote the use of civic media and disruptive technologies â€” from 3D printers to etherpads to apps for direct action. I am the co-founder of Sukey, a platform to keep demonstrators safe, mobile, and informed. I founded OccupyLSX tech, and am a key contributor to Cryptoparty, founding CryptopartyLondon with some friends, and been known to go all-in on initiatives like Hurricane Hackers. I have also worked in industry with companies and for clients. Participating in whichever local Hackspace there is as I travel the world, I repair and hack everything I own, and help the others I meet to become empowered by and involved with hacker culture. I hold a BEng with honors from Durham University, and I am a member of the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET).
