          <div class="body-text">Participating in an Eco-Engineering Course deepened my understanding of environmentally conscious principles within the context of engineering. This valuable foundation enables me to explore creative ways of incorporating sustainability into various engineering aspects while considering overall environmental impacts. Recognizing that technological advancements go hand-in-hand with societal development, I aim to strike a balance between enhancing engineering prowess and fostering positive social change through sustainable strategies.
As a dedicated Sustainability Consultant with a strong background in green engineering, my journey began with an eco-engineering course, followed by an electronic engineering degree. Subsequently, I gained practical experience working in the industry before visiting Open Source Ecology and later participating in transformative projects at Thinkfarm Berlin. The culmination of these experiences prepared me for living and learning within an eco-village.
<br><br>
My diverse range of experiences embraces urban and rural landscapes' essence, blending theoretical knowledge with practical wisdom inspired by aesthetics evoking nature-human endeavor harmony. In bustling cities like London, Berlin, and the USA, I gained valuable insights from progressive organizations and formal educational settings. Through hands-on collaborations at innovative organizations like Open Source Ecology and inspiring communal spaces like Thinkfarm Berlin alongside immersive eco-village living experiences allowed me to explore novel approaches for sustainable living while connecting deeply with nature's simplicity.
<br><br>
These idyllic rural retreats have taught self-sufficiency without relying on state-run infrastructure through activities such as cutting wood for warmth or carrying water for daily needs—a unique perspective merging urban intellectual pursuits with serene natural environments.
<br><br>
I am committed to combining advanced technologies with ecological responsibility—such as involvement in groundbreaking initiatives like Open Source Ecology Project—and collaborative experiences at self-run co-working spaces focused on sociocracy/holacracy principles like Thinkfarm Berlin; shaping societal change toward a more socially just ecologically sustainable future together.
<br><br>
During five years spent engaging hands-on in eco-village living practices—including sustainable forestry management/regenerative practices/voluntary minimalism/extensive recycling initiatives—I experienced running our water system, harvesting wood from managed forests and building homes using natural materials like wood and clay. Surrounded by a supportive community fostering camaraderie while celebrating efforts together through activities such as full moon pizza parties or creating music as a collective.
<br><br>
As a Sustainability Consultant offering comprehensive services grounded in extensive practical experiences, I provide invaluable insight into implementing greener practices tailored specifically to meet each client's unique needs! Drawing from my experience across different settings—London to Berlin to the USA along with immersive eco-village living—I assure clients will receive high-quality advice integrating greener practices into their endeavors for impactful changes across industries.
