<h1>What the client says</h1>
<h2>Best I have encountered.</h2>
<p>By Natasha - 22 Apr 2010</p>
<p>Granted I've not encountered many pc repairers. What I've seen has mostly been a room mate studying computing who is AWFUL and pc world which is amazingly rubbish. Sam appears to be of a different ilk. There should be more like him. He's worth every penny.</p>

<h2>Excellent!</h2>

<p>Dropped the laptop off in the evening crippled with viruses etc. Got it back the very next day and it runs like a dream. Highly recommended!!</p>

<h2>DEll studio</h2>

<p>My laptop was running slow and had a number of issues with unwanted applications so on and also required anti malware etc loading. Sam was very skilled in his field and could explain in plain english what he was going to do and also how this was going to benefit my laptop, giving me advice on things to avoid for the future. It seems to me that Sam is committed to his trade and that of the need of the customer, thus a very honest service and fast service. I will be returning!</p>

<p>Very personal service, unlike many computer repair companies and got the job done very quickly. Clearly knew exactly what he was doing and even gave me some solid advice for keeping my computer virus/problem free in the future! Brilliant, would highly recommend him to anyone!</p>

<h2>Multiple repairs</h2>
<p>By Phil - Mar 12, 2009</p>
<p>Excellent repair service, helped with formatting and recovering data on multiple hard drives as well as repairing numerous faults on laptops and desktop PCs. Very good knowledge of latest technology and programs and also advised on programs and tips to prevent the problems happening again, would recommend to anyone looking for a repair service that does not just fix the symptoms.</p>

<p>Reassuring, communicative and thorough. Informed me at very step what was happening to my precious laptop and OK'd it with me first.</p>
