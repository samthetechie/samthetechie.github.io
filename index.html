        <div class="about-section-content">
          <div class="body-text">I speak English, French and German. I am a well seasoned technologist who establishes technical infrastructure and fosters social patterns that enable collaboration, participation, and innovation. As a co-founder of Sukey, I helped create a platform to keep demonstrators safe, mobile and informed. Additionally, I've been involved with other initiatives like UCLOccupation, OccupyLSX tech, CryptopartyLondon, Hurricane Hackers, Open Source Ecology. I have also had the experience of living in an Eco Village for 5 years. My background includes both working in industry and also participating in local Hackspace communities around the world. Really living and embracing hacker culture, I repair and modify my devices and my stuff as well as assisting others to become more empowered through this approach. I hold a BEng with honors from Durham University and am a member of the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET). Overall, my work focuses on creating transformative solutions using open source hardware and software and civic media tools. At some times this looks like 3D printers and at others like apps designed for direct action - all the while facillitating positive change through (global) collaborative efforts.</div>

The technical embodiment was a suite of networked tools that helps protesters in London avoid police "kettles" (when police illegally corral protesters, passers-by and residents into a small area and detain them for hours without access to food, toilets, or medicine). Sukey was used for the first time on 29th January 2011 at the anti-cuts march in London, and for the first time in recent history, protesters avoided kettling (theirounterparts in Manchester and Edinburgh who don't have Sukey yet weren't so lucky).</div>

My praxis includes but is not limited to engineering consultancy, embedded software development, programming, security consulting, web development, DevOps, Automation, Infrastructure, Cloud... also Webdesign and business development, integration... also building protoypes (hardware and software), robotics -> specifically 3D printing, research, product development, QA and testing, technical support, user training and much more besides, if you are curious feel welcome to ask me! This makes me an invaluable asset for your project whether as a consultant, engineering manager or part of the engineering team. I am equally happy writing frontend javascript or automating server deployment, managing a global team or working closely with a client their dream project.

              <div class="body-text project-card-text">In the age where most
                devices have an IP address, security engineering in hardware
                design and product development is more critical than ever. It is
                important therefore to ensure robustness from the ground up. In
                today's interconnected world, safeguarding hardware design and
                product development is crucial to maintaining integrity across
                all aspects of your business. With my expertise in security
                engineering, I can help you create secure products that protect
                sensitive information while adhering to industry standards.
                Having secure hardware and systems is only a part of the puzzle,
                those systems also exist and are used in the world, by real
                people and on the public internet. Together we can create
                personalized security strategies, reliable network or hardware
                designs or custom-made employee training programs that reinforce
                your business against cyberattacks. Don't leave the safety of
                your digital domain to chance – let's collaborate, tell me about
                the challenges you are facing, I will listen carefully and support and guide you on the process of improving security outcomes for your organisation or project.</div>
