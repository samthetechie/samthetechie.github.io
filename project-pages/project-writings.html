                    Imperfection is the nature of form, otherwise all forms would be the same.&nbsp;
                    &nbsp;
                    To empathise with another being's suffering that suffering needs to be relatable.&nbsp;
                    &nbsp;                    
                    If difference can only be represented as identity, analogy, opposition or similitude, then representation reduces it to the difference between two elements, meaning it is reduced to a principle of comparison.&nbsp;
                    &nbsp;
                    Comparison is not only the thief of self-worth when we compare ourselves to other people but it could also be the basis on which we fail to appreciate the worth of an entity we find in nature, we are representing but not truly or fully observing it.&nbsp;
                    &nbsp;
                    Our empathy might not be extended to the perceived entity for lack of our ability to relate to it.&nbsp;
                    &nbsp;
                    For example I bend down outside and pickup a rock and at first, having not looked very closely, I perceive that it has a weight and texture and form but I failed to perceive that it was in any way alive so therefore I did not represent it as living and by comparison with myself as a living being and in order to be able work out how I might feel towards the rock I might make the comparison: I am alive but the rock is not alive and since we are fundamentally different I do not feel any empathy towards it.&nbsp;
                    &nbsp;
                    Due to the limits of perception of the smallest entity that I can perceive using the human eye, for example what appears to me to be at first a dense smooth irregularly shaped but otherwise inert entity, under a magnification lens, becomes a surface on which an entire ecosystem exists, consisting of small plants, insects, algae, microfungi, bacteria, viruses.&nbsp;
                    &nbsp;
                    If the rock is wet, water being so fundamental to living processes, there is likely to be an even higher chance that life is present.&nbsp;
                    &nbsp;
                    The mere act of disturbing the rock from the original context where it was encountered might have destroyed or otherwise permanently altered the habitat of millions of microscopic beings that I cannot, without technological enhancement of my senses, perceive.&nbsp;
                    &nbsp;
                    Reflecting that the human body is made up of mostly water and bacteria and suppose after a mineral analysis I discover that the rock has some iron deposits inside it, iron being only made in the heart of stars above a certain size, then both the rock and I are children of the same type of star, which is to say we are made up of some of the same stardust, suddenly the rock itself and the entire context in which I found it take on a radically new significance: the type and degree of representations that I can make about increases so much that I feel a degree of empathy towards it accompanied by mutual tolerance and respect for the other living beings and how they came to be and be in that place.&nbsp;
                    &nbsp;
                    Why should I interfere? Certainly not because of our differing forms, relative sizes and subtle or more apparent natures!&nbsp;

                   While there are many strategies (adaptations) in organisms and many niches in living systems, the intervowen tapesty of electron transfer through the metabolic pathways or chemical processes of each form, life and living systems interlock.&nbsp;
                   Where do humans fit in? We seem to keep chaging our minds. To all intents and purposes a city is a desert, a big clearing in the forest. In contrast, in a living ecosystem, like a forest, you need to understand the living systems around you to not damage them. For example after you have lived in a forest for a while, you understand that taking only the dead wood off the forest floor is like choosing to incinerate an entire insect and mycellium hotel, but you also might feel bad at hacking into a perfectly healthy living tree. So you are surrounded by trees but you cannot get any wood without destroying or killing. So you can wait, for example, for a large storm to shake and apply wind shear to the canopies of the trees and then there will be plenty of fallen branches and twigs that were 'ready' to be lost / are sacrificial from the point of view of the life cycle of the tree. Of course nothing is wasted in nature so taking the twigs rather than leaving them on the forest floor means you are denying some of the biomass to the soil which needs to constantly be fed in order to stay alive. Perhaps a compromise might be: after a storm and in order to clear the paths and ways that you already use to move through and around that forested area you can pick up all of the twigs and branches that are blocking the path. Obstructions to the path make it more unsafe to walk on in poor light conditions because you might trip on the branch, being conscious to leave other areas (off of the paths) completely undisturbed particularly that the life forms there can thrive and the soil remains uncompressed by the weight of your body acting through the small surface area of your foot. 'Walking lightly on the land' and indeed through life has a literal as well as a figurative meaning.&nbsp;

                    Here is now, inner stillness, peace&nbsp;
                    and thereby nature will us teach&nbsp;
                    solution to all within our reach&nbsp;
                    just pebbles on a cosmic beach.&nbsp;
                    &nbsp;
                    Hopes of humanity hang like clouds&nbsp;
                    they drift and float and fly around&nbsp;
                    but always returning to the ground&nbsp;
                    as tiny drops, each makes a sound:&nbsp;
                    a little dance, a twist, a shout.&nbsp;
                    &nbsp;
                    All told, drops soak into the earth,&nbsp;
                    a process of death and rebirth,&nbsp;
                    solve for one once and start again,&nbsp;
                    whole then one, earth does reclaim.&nbsp;
                    &nbsp;
                    So back into the world we came&nbsp;
                    to rush and strive and fight in vain&nbsp;
                    remember: each day we have a choice&nbsp;
                    to share our light and heart and voice.&nbsp;
                    &nbsp;
                    With time to heal and time to care,&nbsp;
                    we go from here to anywhere&nbsp;
                    our hearts desire, our minds eye&nbsp;
                    does see the truth in the blue sky.&nbsp;
                    &nbsp;
                    What we imagine, we can make&nbsp;
                    this solemn oath, we now do take:&nbsp;
                    &nbsp;
                    We will pursue our dreams and goals,&nbsp;
                    our aspirations we uphold,&nbsp;
                    We will not do what we are told:&nbsp;
                    'work hard' until we're grey and old.&nbsp;
                    &nbsp;
                    We make the time, our families whole,&nbsp;
                    more time for friends and loved ones so&nbsp;
                    We'll say ‘I love you’- make it known&nbsp;
                    then have more fun when up we've grown.&nbsp;
                    &nbsp;
                    Speak mind through heart, no holding back,&nbsp;
                    nor resenting others, deflect the flak.&nbsp;
                    Be the bigger person and walk away,&nbsp;
                    and live to love another day.&nbsp;
                    &nbsp;
                    Resolve our differences, one by one&nbsp;
                    the path of peace shall overcome.&nbsp;
                    Take time in life to make a home,&nbsp;
                    a family, plans, abundance, sun&nbsp;
                    &nbsp;
                    Happiness is a choice and we made the right one.

                  you wake up again... but you were already 'awake', it's as if you have&nbsp;
                  been operating at different levels of (un)consciousness for most of your life.&nbsp;
                  Who was in control of the throttle? Why were you not taught that there was a throttle?&nbsp;
                  For a brief moment you might have more CPU cycles available because you accidentally&nbsp;
                  took a break from processing the past (depression) or the future&nbsp;
                  (anxiety). In a flash you see the common thread: all of the gentle&nbsp;
                  teachers in your life showed you what freedom means, what harmony means.&nbsp;
                  What a beautiful way they have! So much inspiration. They are the&nbsp;
                  gentle, empathic, caring and loving presence that has always been but&nbsp;
                  never shouted over the noise to be heard. Never used force over you to meet&nbsp;
                  their needs or those of others. Despite being the strongest (peaceful)&nbsp;
                  warriors. How come the flowers and the butterflies were just outside the&nbsp;
                  periphery of vision the whole time? Where they hiding or was I not&nbsp;
                  seeing? To understand is to see. Sadly egos are attracted to bigger egos&nbsp;
                  and someone who doesn't define themselves based on your approval (or&nbsp;
                  not), will not fight to be heard / does not need that kind of&nbsp;
                  validation. The most beautiful teachers can be found *everywhere* on the&nbsp;
                  level of every-day experience but might be camouflaged- an adaptation to&nbsp;
                  adverse-world, worse still they might have developed spikes and be quick&nbsp;
                  to flight and slow to trust because of the impersonal brutal forces&nbsp;
                  (invisible to ourselves because we never felt them) and to the pressure&nbsp;
                  of predation. Can we understand each other's pain better now? Oh no.&nbsp;
                  What did we do to ourselves? Can we see now why some make camouflage&nbsp;
                  to hide? Why they might melt into the background? Others are eager to&nbsp;
                  please just to form a mutual core (although never on equal terms and&nbsp;
                  everybody looses as a result)&nbsp;

                  So we see our developmental context was a mind-dominated culture and we&nbsp;
                  specialised ourselves as human adjuncts to machines. The primary focus&nbsp;
                  is efficiency and working to accumulate more 'knowledge', but wait: who&nbsp;
                  wrote the books?&nbsp;

                        "They cannot imagine if they do not see it in a book&nbsp;
                    Even when they see it it's their book that tell them how to look&nbsp;

                            Think white them think straight&nbsp;
                            Think like they book say&nbsp;
                            Think like, they think like&nbsp;
                            They think like they book say...&nbsp;

                    ...Truth is not a theory that can be imprisoned in any book&nbsp;
                    Word are sometimes. Prison sometimes prisms from the way you look"&nbsp;

                  So how to explain the heart, develop intuition or develop careful&nbsp;
                  hearing? Were we not all born with the same language: love? So if that&nbsp;
                  is the only language we know before we are socialised into families,&nbsp;
                  schools, the workplace and as citizens where does the violence come&nbsp;
                  from? What kind of society would teach violence to children?&nbsp;

                                      "Words like violence&nbsp;
                                      Break the silence&nbsp;

                                      Painful to me&nbsp;
                                      Pierce right through me&nbsp;
                                      Can't you understand&nbsp;
                                      Oh my little girl&nbsp;
                                      &nbsp;
                                      All I ever wanted&nbsp;
                                      All I ever needed&nbsp;
                                      Is here in my arms&nbsp;
                                      Words are very unnecessary&nbsp;
                                      They can only do harm"&nbsp;

                  So how could we calibrate when we were lost at sea without a compass and&nbsp;
                  all the maps and notes are written by violent war-makers? How to 'see'&nbsp;
                  in terms other than 'enemy images'?&nbsp;

                  How much fragmentation has occurred when the neurons in the heart were&nbsp;
                  not involved in the most formative and critical parts of development&nbsp;
                  during young childhood and adolescence? Critically: once you work out&nbsp;
                  what happened, what does the road back look like?&nbsp;

                  To avoid this waste of potential in the future: what about raising&nbsp;
                  awareness of this phenomenon / developmental arc and having a bit of&nbsp;
                  consensus about something like a tabula rasa for our children and their&nbsp;
                  children (if they so choose)? Knowing that from this point we may see a&nbsp;
                  highest possible future and letting the arrow fly after it has been&nbsp;
                  fired, the arrow might see another highest possible future that we could&nbsp;
                  never conceive of. So how would you best support them as a parent in the&nbsp;
                  current context? What language will you teach them? The language of the&nbsp;
                  heart (which they are born knowing and which we have mostly forgotten)&nbsp;
                  or the language of the mind-dominated cultures which will 'best' prepare&nbsp;
                  them for the world and it's sharp tongues which get sharper the more&nbsp;
                  they are used?&nbsp;

                  If not from birth then what is the 'age of self-determination or reason'&nbsp;
                  for beginning to hone the kind of awareness and intentionality that is&nbsp;
                  peaceful, knowing (with the heart) and present and leading to authentic&nbsp;
                  self-expression and relating and right action given the current&nbsp;
                  circumstance? Or do all attempts at some pre-conceived notion of success&nbsp;
                  result in worse backlash, failure and counter-veiling forces? The brutal&nbsp;
                  reality for some will then be continually searching an infinite fractal&nbsp;
                  complexity and fragmentation of space and time with only a narrow beam&nbsp;
                  of consciousness to light their way. If all you had was a narrow beam&nbsp;
                  and every individual has a different internal nebula, what would be a&nbsp;
                  meta strategy (a strategy to develop one's own strategy)? As many ways&nbsp;
                  as there are reasons for being, never before seen in nature. One could&nbsp;
                  try going back inside to find out who was asking the question. Then you&nbsp;
                  realise that the lights will flicker on and off from time to time and it&nbsp;
                  can be painful to be 'trapped' inside such a confining space.&nbsp;
                  For example: how can you explain this to an old friend who had already&nbsp;
                  moved on and forgotten your name, that you had wronged in the past when&nbsp;
                  you didn't even know what you didn't know? So then comes the question:&nbsp;
                  is this realisation a useful adaptation to present circumstances?&nbsp;
                  Is it dangerous? Is it just a normal part of development / evolution?&nbsp;
                  How do other people cope with this feeling and what are you once you&nbsp;
                  stop defining yourself in reaction to things? Part of the solution&nbsp;
                  might be to start wearing blank t-shirts instead of logos and symbols&nbsp;
                  because ideas are just more excuses to separate I from I.&nbsp;
