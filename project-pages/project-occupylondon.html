        <div class="body-text">The tech team was a working group of engineers and techies which supported the main movement with on-the-ground tech support, digital security, online infrastructure, electricity, internet access and sometimes to stretch the legs and get a break from the computer a bit of police counter-surveillance and psyops. We were one of the first working groups up and running. "I left, I left, I had a good job and I left, I left because I thought it was right, left, right, left."</div>

          <div class="body-text">Occupy London was a political movement in London, England, and part of the international Occupy movement. While some media described it as an "anti-capitalist" movement, in the statement written and endorsed by consensus by the Occupy assembly in the first two days of the occupation, occupiers defined themselves as a movement working to create alternatives to an "unjust and undemocratic" system.</div>
