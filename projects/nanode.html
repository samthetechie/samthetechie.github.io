      <div class="main-title">Nanode</div>
      <div class="body-text">I was part of the Nanode Dev team. The main inventor of the Nanode Hardware was Ken Boak. Nanode is an open source Arduino-like board that has in-built web connectivity. It is a low cost platform for creative development of web connected ideas. Languages: C
      <br>
      In Ken's words: "When I designed the hardware for Nanode, I worked to a very tight budget. It had to appeal to college students, amateurs and hackers.
      <br>
      Working in association with the London Hackspace I fixed the price (for members) at £18 ($30) and we initially built a batch of 100 units. We ran a couple of weekend workshops and built them up from kits. Shipping costs were not included – and we have seen a rise in some of the IC prices since then.
      <br>
      That was in early June. Since then we have produced a total of 550 pcbs so far – and shipped 450 of them.
      Nanode is now available in the US, exclusively from http://wickeddevice.com in upstate New York.
      <br>
      Wicked Device will soon be making their own run of pcbs ready on the market in time for the NYC Maker Faire.
      <br>
      From the start, Nanode had to be simple and straightforward to build – with conventional through hole components and socketed ICs. Following our pictorial assembly guide, I have seen dozens of Nanodes built by beginners – often their first real soldering project.
      <br>
      We are not trying to compete in any way with 32bit ARM devices – but we wanted a board that worked like an Arduino with a few extra features, such as ethernet connectivity and easy wireless and wired networking.
      <br>
      Nanode is intended as a starter kit for web connected devices such as remote control, home automation and smart sensors. Later on there will be other variants, with built in wireless and available as a very compact SMT module.
      <br>
      Nanode does not yet offer PoE, and you will need a FTDI or similar USB to serial adaptor cable to program it. In that respect it is similar to the standard version of the Ethernet Arduino – but a fraction of the price.
      <br>
      Nanode is looking for resellers in Europe and Asia. If you want to get involved either commercially or join in with collaborative development, please contact me via @Monsonite on Twitter.

          <div class="body-text">The Nanode project, launched at London hackspace, is an open source Arduino-like board with built-in web connectivity (IoT). It can connect to various wireless, wired, and ethernet interfaces, allowing for the development of web-based sensor and control systems. It provides web access to six analogue sensor lines and six digital I/O lines, making it ideal for hacking projects. The Nanode is affordable, costing under £20 as an easy-to-build kit. It has gained popularity and has been replicated in hackerspaces and workshops across Europe. Additionally, it has been featured on Hackaday, a popular online platform for DIY electronics projects.</div>
