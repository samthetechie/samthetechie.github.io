          <div class="body-text">As a Firmware Engineer working on the Classic 4 Electro Accupuncture/TENS treatment device I made various hardware and software contributions to improve UI / UX, increase the number of treatment modes and make it easier for users to control the device via the keypad. Mostly this consisted of embedded software development in CPP, C and PIC programming in assembly.</div>
          <div class="body-text">
<pre>
Here are some details about the device's capabilities, modes and features:
-Ability to treat different patterns with different electricity parameters.
-Capable of tonify one channel and sedate another channel at the same time.
-Acting concurrently as electro-acupuncture stimulator and TENS / MNS unit.

Single Mode: the parameters of the four channels (outputs) are independent
of each other and controllable by the user.

Paired Mode: four channels are arranged in two pairs (CH1 & CH2)
and (CH3 & CH4) and the pulses on each pair are simultaneous (+/-20 microseconds).

Sync Mode: four channels are synchronised in time and share the same parameters.

Sequential Mode: parameters programmatically change over the course of the treatment.

Compact and Elegant design. Four output channels that can stimulate
up to a total of eight needles, or four pairs of electrodes.

A wide range of frequencies between 0.5 Hz and 200 Hz, in 24 pre-set settings.

The outputs can be symmetrical biphasic or monophasic up to 60mA across a
1K resistive load, with an adjustable pulse width of 64, 128, 192
or 256 microseconds. The outputs is locked to 20mA by default for 
acupuncture stimulating. Channel short-circuits protection.

Audio signals to indicate operational error and end of treatment.

25 Pre-set programmes. 8 user defined programmes (save/load slots).

Large back-lit LCD screen 128 x 128 dots.
